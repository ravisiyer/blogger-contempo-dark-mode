Add CSS:

/* ============================================================
   üåö Dark Mode Colors (used only when darkmode-optin is active)
============================================================ */
:root {
  --dark-bg: #121212;
  --dark-text: #e0e0e0;
  --dark-link: #bb86fc;
  --dark-blockquote-bg: #333333;
  --dark-blockquote-text: #e0e0e0;
}

/* ============================================================
   üñ•Ô∏è System Dark Mode Support (auto-detect)
   Active only when user has opted in AND system prefers dark
============================================================ */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body.darkmode-optin .post-body {
    background-color: var(--dark-bg) !important;
    color: var(--dark-text) !important;
  }

  body.darkmode-optin a {
    color: var(--dark-link) !important;
  }

  body.darkmode-optin blockquote {
    background-color: var(--dark-blockquote-bg) !important;
    color: var(--dark-blockquote-text) !important;
  }

  body.darkmode-optin .post-title {
    color: var(--dark-text) !important;
  }
}

JS Gadget code unchanged
--------------------

Works for many but not all elements in blog post page.
If darkmode-optin class is present in body (added by JS when darkModeEnabled local storage variable is true), then
	CSS styles above are applied to many elements but not all if Chrome setting is dark mode.
	CSS styles above are NOT applied to any elements if Chrome setting is light mode.
If darkmode-optin class is absent in body (removed by JS when darkModeEnabled local storage variable is false), then
	CSS styles above are NOT applied to any elements irrespective of Chrome setting being light or dark mode.
	
So the elements to which the above styles are not getting added (in Chrome dark mode and darkModeEnabled in JS) have to be identified and then added to above CSS. I will do that a little later.

But now the basic approach seems to have got validated. Some issues remain including icon-button not showing for most window widths except close to max. width on PC (at which time menu bar is shown on left). But those are relatively smaller issues.
