Add CSS:
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body.darkmode-optin .post-title {
    background-color: black !important;
    color: white !important;
  }
----
JS Gadget code unchanged
--------------------

Works for post title element (h3 element). 
If darkmode-optin class is present in body (added by JS when darkModeEnabled local storage variable is true), then
	CSS styles below are applied to post title if Chrome setting is dark mode.
	CSS styles below are NOT applied to post title if Chrome setting is light mode.
If darkmode-optin class is absent in body (removed by JS when darkModeEnabled local storage variable is false), then
	CSS styles below are NOT applied to post title irrespective of Chrome setting being light or dark mode.
