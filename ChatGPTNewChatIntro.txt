This is related to my previous posts on adding dark mode to Blogger Contempo Light Theme. I would first like to provide you the current code which is primarily in two parts:
1) JustBeforeEndHead.html - Has code to be added just before end head tag in Theme HTML
2) JustBeforeEndBody.html - Has code to be added just before end body tag in Theme HTML

There is a menu entry for toggling appearance mode: In Layout, in a Pages gadget (add it if not already present), a page is added with following details:
    - Page name: Appearance Mode
    - Page URL: javascript:openModal(false)
	
Given below is code for JustBeforeEndHead.html . Please note it. Then I will provide next file code.
